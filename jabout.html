               Hello to all reading this! My name is Gavin Solomon and I am a 19 year old student at the Universtiy of Oregon.
               I grew up in Tustin, California. Which is a city in Orange County nestled between San Diego and Los Angeles.
               I grew up living with my Mom, Dad, Older Sister Megan, and our late dog Harley. From a young age I have always been incredibly social and out going.
               People were always of intrest to me and I was never shy to strike up a conversation in the hopes of making a new friend. Throughout my childhood I made personal connection with everyone.
               Wether it was my teachers, classmates, friends and their families, or a worker doing something for me. People shapped me to be the person I am today by teaching me to never be quick to judge.

                From a young age I was always fascinated by music. I would sing songs all the time to myself and other people and when I turned 9 my parents finaly did something about it.
                On my 9th birthday they bought me my first guitar and enrolled me in lessons. Guitar quickly became a pivotal part of my life and I fell in love with the journey of playing.
                Music now become a world for me to understand and grow my knowledge anyway I could. A couple years later I tacked on the drums and the bass and began playing in band settings with other people.
                As I grew into high school I began to really learn how infinite the music world was and began going to as many concerts as possible. I continue this passion as much as I can and hope other people can learn the power of Live music.
